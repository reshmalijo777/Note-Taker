## Installation

To run this project we need to install Node.js. Then create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. We need `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies. Type `node server.js` or `npm start` to start the server.
